Final Project for CMPSC 441/GAME 450
Run the Lab11 agent_enviorment.py to run the program, It will take a bit to load that is normal

Report
Abstract:
For this Project we were tasked with creating a game that takes advantage of several AI concepts. These would be used to implement different aspects of the game that when combined would create a functioning product. The game we were tasked to make was supposed to replicate the adventures of a young elf named Ollilli, as he travels across vast landscapes from city to city to reach his final destination. As he travels between cities he can be beset by bandits who he must fight off to continue his journey. Gold is also a factor in his quest across the land. Traveling across mountains and lakes isn’t cheap and if he runs out of money he could end up stranded in the treacherous hills. Losing to the bandits that assail him also lose him money while defeating them allows him to claim their ill-gotten goods. The combat system is turned base and functions similarly to “Rock Paper Scissors”, with each combatant choosing their weapon and the loser of the clash losing health. When one of the fighters hit zero hit points, they lose and the winner takes their money. This will result in our hero Ollilli losing the game, and should be avoided. Traveling along the routes, if the player reaches the final city then they win the game and it ends. I also attempted to add an AI generated Journaling function. While the text generation does function, the responses generated by the AI are utter nonsense and despite my tinkering could not be improved in the short time I had while juggling other assignments.

Problems Solved

In our game, we have a combat system where the player and the computer face off in a game of “Rock Paper Scissors”. In this game the player picks from one of three options: Sword, Arrow or Fire. The AI Opponent also selects one of the three options depending on a predetermined algorithm based on its current HP. During the course of this project we implemented a Model based Reflex agent that could fight the AI for us and win a majority of the time. A Model Based Reflex agent keeps track of past states and takes action based on those previous states and the current visible state. In our project, the AIPlayerCombat program keeps track of previously played choices on both sides and decides what to play next based on that information. For Example, let's say the AI played Sword for the last two rounds. Based on that information, the reflex based agent would choose something that beats a sword since our AI has a strategy programmed in for if the opponent is playing the same thing over and over again. The AI continues to play and adjust strategy as the game evolves and different choices are made until it wins or loses. This AI Component solves the problem of the AI player losing combats often ending the game early by having the AI apply relevant strategies to defeat the opposing AI in each combat.

Our game requires a Map with varied terrain to populate with random cities and routes between them. Since the player has to travel between cities spending money depending on the tip of terrain traveled over, our map needs that varied terrain to reference as the player travels. The answer to this problem uses Perlin Noise. Perlin Noise is a type of gradient noise that can be used to procedurally generate random terrain among many other uses. Using random midpoint displacement it creates semi-realistic terrain that creates mountains and hills, as well as ponds, lakes, and seas. We differentiate these elevations by assigning each value a color that is written to the screen when the map is displayed. Lower elevations are depicted by pixels colored blue to depict water while higher elevations are depicted with white tiles to represent mountain tops. Greener pixels are used to represent milder elevations between the two extremes. This allows the game to visually represent the differing costs of travel between cities by showing the mountains and lakes you would have to travel through while also allowing the program to reference the generated elevation values to determine the total cost of the travel between cities. This adds a layer of difficulty and strategy to the game since the player must choose their paths wisely.

Our cities are randomly placed on our map so they could end up being placed anywhere. This means they might end up placed on top of each or too close. It also means they could be placed on the top of mountains or in the depths of the ocean which makes no sense. We solve this problem using genetic algorithms. Genetic algorithms work by running randomly generated a baseline version of a solution. The algorithm then checks the solution created and grades it based on predefined measures of “fitness”. This means that if the algorithm likes how certain assets of the solution were generated it’s fitness increases, while if it didn’t like it the fitness decreases. Depending on the results of the fitness of the solution, it generates a new solution attempting to improve its fitness score until it reaches an acceptable level of fitness to accomplish the task. In our version, It measures fitness of the generated map and cities by a few factors. First, it makes sure cities are a certain distance apart and not on top of each other. Then, it makes sure each city is not above or below certain elevations. This is to prevent them from being created on top of mountains or in oceans as previously mentioned. Then based on the fitness it either returns the city locations and map or tries again until the algorithm considers it “Fit”.

Finally, our project requested we add an additional AI component to the project. In my project I attempted to add an AI generated journal. I planned to use OpenAI to generate short Journal entries of the protagonist Ollilli as he traveled between cities. When the player arrived at a city, the program would send a request to OpenAI with a prompt for it’s AI to respond to, asking it to generate a journal entry for Ollilii in his journal as he traveled between cities. The AI would return a response to the prompt which my program would take and display to the player for them to read. It could also be modified to be written into a text file for the player to read instead of being printed to the console as I did in my implementation. Specifically according to ChatGPT itself,
 “As an AI language model, I generate responses to prompts using a technique called "deep learning". Specifically, I use a variant of deep learning called a "transformer" architecture, which was developed by researchers at Google in 2017.
At a high level, the transformer architecture works by processing a large amount of text data and using that data to "learn" patterns and relationships between words and phrases. This learning is done through a process called "training", in which the model is given a large corpus of text data and adjusted to optimize its ability to predict the next word in a sequence.
Once the model has been trained, it can be used to generate responses to new prompts by processing the prompt and using its learned knowledge to predict the most likely words or phrases to follow. This is done using a technique called "autoregressive" generation, in which the model generates one word or phrase at a time, conditioned on the previous words that have been generated.
To generate responses that are coherent and meaningful, the transformer architecture uses a number of techniques, including attention mechanisms, which allow the model to focus on different parts of the input sequence, and positional encoding, which helps the model understand the order of words in a sentence.”
With this in mind, I was able to leverage ChatGPT with my project so that every time the player reaches a city, It generates a journal entry for Ollilli and displays it to the command line. With this method, my program was able to use AI to generate random journal entries for our hero as he attempts to reach his final destination.

Unfinished Sections of the Project:
Unfortunately due to juggling other projects, graduation and the stress of moving so immediately after graduation I was unable to fully implement all of the additional changes requested for the final submission. I can perhaps be blamed on poor time management on my end however I believe it important to bring up as it is relevant to the final project that I will be turning in. While some parts of that need to be implement seem like they would be fairly easy to implement, due to local computer issues involving pip (again) and the existence of OneDrive, I just do not have the mental stamina to fully complete those sections and am willing to take the point loss on those items.

Record of ChatGPT Correspondence
How do I use you in a python to generate journal entries?
ChatGPT
As an AI language model, I can be used in a Python program to generate journal entries in a variety of ways. Here's one way to get started:
Install the OpenAI API package by running pip install openai in your terminal.
Sign up for an OpenAI API key if you haven't already done so, and store it in a secure location.
Import the openai package and set your API key as an environment variable. You can do this by adding the following lines to your Python program:

Define a function that takes a prompt as input, sends it to the OpenAI API for completion, and returns the generated text. Here's an example function:

This function uses the OpenAI API to generate text based on the prompt provided. It uses the Davinci engine, which is the most powerful and capable engine available, but also the most expensive. You can choose a different engine if you prefer.
Define a prompt that describes the format and content of the journal entry you want to generate. Here's an example prompt:

Call the generate_text() function with your prompt as input, and store the generated text in a variable. Here's an example:
Save the generated text to a file or database, or use it in your program as needed.
Note that the quality and coherence of the generated text may vary depending on the complexity of the prompt and the engine used, so it's a good idea to experiment with different prompts and settings to see what works best for your use case.

That didn't work
ChatGPT
I'm sorry to hear that! Can you please provide me with more information about the issue you encountered? Did you encounter any error messages or unexpected behavior? Knowing more about the problem will help me provide a more specific solution.


AttributeError: module 'openai_secret_manager' has no attribute 'get_services'
ChatGPT
I apologize for the confusion. The openai_secret_manager module has been updated since my knowledge cutoff, and the get_services() function is no longer available.
Here's an updated version of the code that should work with the current version of the openai_secret_manager module:
This code defines a function generate_journal_entry() that uses the OpenAI API to generate a journal entry based on a prompt. The API key is loaded securely using the openai_secret_manager module, and the openai module is used to send requests to the OpenAI API.
You can call this function from your Python program to generate a journal entry, like this:
Please let me know if you have any further questions or issues.

how do I find my API key?
ChatGPT
To find your OpenAI API key, you will need to follow these steps:
Go to the OpenAI website (https://openai.com/) and click on "Sign In" in the top right corner of the page.
Enter your email address and password to log in to your OpenAI account.
Once you are logged in, click on your name in the top right corner of the page and select "Dashboard" from the drop-down menu.
On the dashboard, you should see a section called "API Keys" with a button labeled "Create New API Key". Click on this button to create a new API key.
Give your API key a name and a description to help you remember what it's used for. You can also select the permissions you want to grant to this key, depending on what you plan to use it for.
Once you have filled in the details, click on the "Create" button to generate your new API key.
Copy your API key and store it in a secure location, such as a password manager or a secure file on your computer.
Note that you should treat your API key as a sensitive piece of information and avoid sharing it with others or storing it in an insecure location. If you suspect that your API key has been compromised, you can revoke it on the OpenAI dashboard and create a new one.


There is no sign in button in the top right corner\
ChatGPT
I apologize for the confusion. It seems that OpenAI has made some changes to their website recently. Here's an updated set of instructions for finding your API key:
Go to the OpenAI website (https://openai.com/) and click on "API" in the top menu.
Scroll down to the "Access the API" section and click on the "Sign up for OpenAI" button.
Fill out the registration form to create an OpenAI account. You will need to provide your email address, full name, and a password.
Once you have registered, you should be redirected to the OpenAI dashboard. If not, click on your name in the top right corner of the page and select "Dashboard" from the drop-down menu.
On the dashboard, you should see a section called "API Keys" with a button labeled "Generate API Key". Click on this button to create a new API key.
Give your API key a name and a description to help you remember what it's used for. You can also select the permissions you want to grant to this key, depending on what you plan to use it for.
Once you have filled in the details, click on the "Generate" button to create your new API key.
Copy your API key and store it in a secure location, such as a password manager or a secure file on your computer.
Note that you should treat your API key as a sensitive piece of information and avoid sharing it with others or storing it in an insecure location. If you suspect that your API key has been compromised, you can revoke it on the OpenAI dashboard and create a new one.


    return openai_secret_manager.get_secret(key_name)
           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

RecursionError: maximum recursion depth exceeded
ChatGPT
I apologize for the error. It seems that there's a circular import issue in the openai_secret_manager module. To fix this, you can modify your code as follows:
This code uses the json module to extract the API key from the secure storage returned by the openai_secret_manager.get_secret() function. This should avoid the circular import issue.
Please let me know if this resolves the issue, or if you have any further questions.

What do I replace the "openai" and "api_key" Strings with?
ChatGPT
The "openai" string is the name of the secret that you created when you stored your OpenAI API key in the OpenAI Secret Manager. If you used a different name when you stored your secret, replace "openai" with that name instead.
The "api_key" string refers to the name of the key in the JSON object that contains your OpenAI API key. When you created your API key on the OpenAI dashboard, you gave it a name, and this name appears as a key in the JSON object that the openai_secret_manager.get_secret() function returns. The value associated with this key is your actual API key, which you need to pass to the openai.api_key attribute to authenticate your API requests.
By default, the OpenAI API key is stored in a key called "api_key" in the JSON object returned by the get_secret() function. If you used a different key name when you created your API key, replace "api_key" with that name instead.
Here's an example of what the secrets dictionary might look like:
python
Copy code
secrets = { "api_key": "your_actual_api_key_here" }
In this case, "api_key" is the key name, and "your_actual_api_key_here" is the value associated with that key. You would use this dictionary to set the openai.api_key attribute, like so:
I hope that clears things up! Let me know if you have any other questions.

Even with these additions the same error is occuring
ChatGPT
I apologize for the continued issue. It's possible that the recursion error is being caused by another part of your code. In any case, I would suggest trying to increase the recursion limit by adding the following line to the beginning of your Python file:
This will increase the recursion limit to 1,000,000, which should be more than enough for most applications.
If this doesn't solve the problem, please let me know and I'll do my best to help you debug the issue.


It did not solve the issue
ChatGPT
I'm sorry to hear that increasing the recursion limit didn't help. Let's try a different approach.
Instead of using the openai_secret_manager module to load your API key, you can try loading it directly from a JSON file. Here's an updated version of your code that does this:
In this code, you would need to create a file called openai-api-key.json in the same directory as your Python file, with the following contents:
Replace "your_actual_api_key_here" with your actual OpenAI API key.
If this still doesn't work, please let me know the specific error message you're seeing and any additional details about your setup, and I'll do my best to help you debug the issue.


 FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'openai-api-key.json'
ChatGPT
The FileNotFoundError means that the program can't find the file called openai-api-key.json in the current working directory.
You need to make sure that the openai-api-key.json file is located in the same directory as your Python file, and that the name is spelled exactly as "openai-api-key.json" (including the .json file extension).
If the file is in the same directory and is named correctly, you can try adding the following line of code to print out the current working directory:
This will print out the path to the current working directory. Make sure that the openai-api-key.json file is located in this directory.
If you're still having trouble, please let me know and I'll do my best to help you further.

what are some engine options
ChatGPT
Here are some of the engine options that are currently available in the OpenAI API:
davinci: This is the most capable and powerful engine, with a wide range of capabilities and the ability to generate high-quality text across many use cases.
curie: This is a slightly smaller and less capable engine than davinci, but still offers high-quality text generation across a range of use cases.
babbage: This engine is designed to handle natural language processing tasks that require a high degree of specificity and detail, such as answering trivia questions or solving word problems.
ada: This engine is optimized for language tasks that require a high degree of creativity and the ability to generate novel content, such as creative writing or generating unique product descriptions.
Each engine has different strengths and weaknesses, so you may want to experiment with different engines to find the one that works best for your particular use case.


My responses from the AI are poor and often repeat several times. What should I do?
ChatGPT
If you're getting poor responses from the OpenAI API, there are a few things you can try to improve the quality of the generated text:
Try a different engine: Each engine has its own strengths and weaknesses, so you may want to try using a different engine to see if it produces better results for your use case.
Adjust the temperature: The temperature parameter controls the "creativity" of the generated text. A higher temperature will produce more diverse and unexpected responses, but may also result in lower-quality text. A lower temperature will produce more conservative and predictable responses, but may result in more coherent and readable text. You can try adjusting the temperature parameter to see if it produces better results.
Provide more specific prompts: The more specific and detailed your prompt is, the better the AI will be able to understand what you're asking for and generate relevant text. Make sure your prompts are as clear and specific as possible.
Provide more context: Providing more context to the AI can help it generate more relevant and coherent responses. For example, if you're generating text about a specific topic, you could provide the AI with some background information or context about that topic.
Use the stop parameter: The stop parameter tells the AI to stop generating text after a certain point. This can be useful if the AI is generating irrelevant or repetitive text. For example, you could set the stop parameter to a specific word or phrase that indicates the end of the text you're looking for.
Increase the max_tokens parameter: The max_tokens parameter controls the maximum length of the generated text. If you're getting short and repetitive responses, you could try increasing the max_tokens parameter to see if it produces longer and more varied responses.
Fine-tune the model: If you have a large amount of training data or specific requirements for your text generation task, you may want to consider fine-tuning the OpenAI API's models to better fit your needs. This involves training the AI on a specific dataset or set of prompts to improve its performance for your particular use case.
Remember that the quality of the generated text can also depend on the specific task you're trying to perform, as well as the quality and specificity of your input data and prompts.


How do you as an AI generate responses to prompts?

As an AI language model, I generate responses to prompts using a technique called "deep learning". Specifically, I use a variant of deep learning called a "transformer" architecture, which was developed by researchers at Google in 2017.

Overall, the process of generating responses to prompts using a deep learning language model like myself is a complex and highly mathematical process, but one that has shown impressive results in recent years, particularly in the field of natural language processing.


How do I use ChatGPT Specifically in my Python Program?
ChatGPT
To use ChatGPT in your Python program, you can use OpenAI's official Python package called openai, which provides a simple interface for interacting with the GPT models.
Here's an example of how to use ChatGPT to generate text in Python:

How do I use your model
ChatGPT
To use my model to generate text, you can follow these general steps:
Install the openai Python package by running pip install openai in your terminal.
Set up your OpenAI API key as described earlier in this conversation.
Create a new OpenAI API instance by calling openai.api_key = "YOUR_API_KEY_HERE".
Call the openai.Completion.create() method to generate text. You'll need to provide the following parameters:
engine: The name of the GPT model you want to use. For example, "text-davinci-002".
prompt: The text prompt you want to use to generate the text.
temperature: Controls the "creativity" of the generated text. A higher temperature will produce more creative and varied responses, while a lower temperature will produce more conservative responses.
max_tokens: Controls the length of the generated text, in terms of the number of tokens (words or punctuation marks).
n: The number of responses to generate.
stop: A list of tokens that, if generated, will signal the end of the response.
Extract the generated text from the API response and use it however you like.
Here's an example of how to generate text using my model:
This code will generate a response to the prompt "What is the meaning of life?" using my model, and print the generated text to the console. You can modify the prompt and other parameters to generate different kinds of text.


what is your model?
